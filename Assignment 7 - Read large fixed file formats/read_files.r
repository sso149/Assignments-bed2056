#This file contains the function to read the data for this assignment in to a data frame

library(tidyverse)

#Function to read large data sets in a directory.
#Note: The position for the data in the files is hard coded in the function.
# loc: location of the data, default to current directory.
# pattern: pattern to look for in the file names (example ".txt" will only use all the text files).

  #Get all the files we want in a list (with full path)
  files = list.files(path=loc, pattern=pattern, full.names=TRUE)
  #Uses map from tidyverse to read the data from all files
  #Map uses read_fwf tidyverse to actually read the fixed format files.

Below is the number of Commencement of liquidation proceedings for each region in 2018, 2019 and 2020. This will show if there is a rise in bankruptcies from 2018 and 2019 to 2020.

```{r data, echo=FALSE, comment=NA, message=FALSE }
data <- helper(2018,2020,1,12)
```

```{r plot, echo=FALSE, comment=NA, message=FALSE }
helper_plot(data)
```

From the graphs above we can not say the corona pandemic have lead to an increase in bankruptcies compared to the previous years.
